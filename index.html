        <p>We had a long day ahead of us so we started early in the morning. A ground transport vehicle (GTV) came and took us to breakfast. That's me on the right with my back to the camera stepping into one of the many GTV we would use that day.</p>
        <p>During breakfast they gave us our itinerary.</p>

            Ends with us relaxing after a sucessful mission to the moon. Who didn't make it in the photo?
            I stand in front of the sink. My eyes open and look out past the darkened kitchen to the chalky 
            table in the backyard. It was in the neighbors trash before, and before that probably some store.
            I'm not interested in the history or even that it is a table. I want to see how the light will move
            and the detail change.
            
            Chair, a physical opbject to which all other forms refrence. It is large, takes up space and seems to
            exist independent of its name. The image of a chair is a reasonble representaion of the chair, but
            it is a shallow copy at best. Although it referes to a specific chair, it cannot do many of the things
            that the physical chair can do that let us call the chair, a chair. The definition of a chair is its essance,
             the blue print that every chair was built from. Can it be used as a test to determine what is chair? How inacurate to say a chair is
            first a definition and the object itself follows. A philisofical conversaion could take place with
            arguemtns being made as to what IS the chair. But I want none of that. The chair in front of me is 
            only a chair becuase I have decided to tell you about what I am looking at.
            
            I am looking at the light reflecting off the fabric and the texture of the wooden arms. The shine of the 
            wood, the way the light passes though the edges of the fabric. It stands up just barely like the stubble. The shadow from the arm is soft. 
            From where I sit the closest arm slopes a little quicker as to leaves the back. 
            Sometimes it is not enough to descibe it as a chair and in doing so, reduce it to some function, its boiled down 
            definition. 
            
            Chair "a seat typically having four legs and a back for one person" Merriam-Webster.
            Language simultanioulsy gives us the ability to refer to a specific chair and all chairs, with the
            option of refering to something called a chair but not intened for sitting. It is strange how flexible
             the words are and how important the context when tying to make sense of it all.

            
            To say there is a chair in the corner, would produce a simmilar idea in everyones mind. 
            If i want to say something gernal about chairs like I need somewhere to sit someone bring me a chair,
            then it is useful for there will be many sutible optiopns.

            Each one needs to be lovingly
             addressed. Each one needs to be seen for what it's. The paintchip describes how thick the paint No, 
            
            I like to look at things. Not, to look and simply notice that it's say, a chair.
            Thats easy. That's how some director's note might read. In the corner there is
        a chair. It tells us nothing other than that everyone Seeing. A certain pleasure from 
        seeing what’s in front of me. Actually looking at it and noticing scars and seeing a story. 
        A history that belongs to it. It’s not good enough it’s a chair. Why is it THZiA chair. 
        I guess it’s a bit of a habit I’ve picked up from spending time drawing. To see what is 
        in front of me keeps me grounded. To hear how found bounces off of it to see the glow of 
        color on the side walk.
        Car doors light
        Asfault at a scance
        Or any thing at a sever angle, reflects.
        A stray hair on a head
        The sun moving on the ground
        The is a table in our back yard. When I look out the kitchen window it’s there. 
        White set against a black ground. The sun has caught its painted surface. Sometimes 
        it’s muted and the contours of the carved lions are Bearly a chalky blur. The light 
        when it’s caught is forever moving, pushing the shadow of the table around the yard. 
        Maybe that me where the chickens learned to get excersize without actually going anywhere. 
        Sometime the ornamental grass in the neighbors yard shows off by igniting to a glowing blaze 
        when the suns attention flirts with its log thin arms. I could sit on the porch and watch 
        the moss grow on the bench in the driveway, or look at the way the cable guy attached the 
        cable to the house. Sometimes I watch my myself watching. Watching watching watching.. 
        just seeing what it is I see. The other day I asked myself how can I see what I’m not 
        looking for? When I visited grandma we waited for few shower to be finished. From our 
        seats I could see the suns edge displayed across the side walk outside. I watched it move. 
        Another time I saw a star and sat very sill and lined it up with the corner of a distant 
        leaf. As I sat there I could see even if I couldn’t feel it, the earth was moving. It’s 
        not some true essence that captivated me, it’s the process. Literally noticing the physical 
        qualities, shapes abs materieal properties. .</p>
